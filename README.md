# DSA with Java

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions implemented in Java. The code is organized by topics, showcasing various problem-solving techniques and Java programming skills.

## Topics Covered

- Patterns
- Arrays
- Sorting Algorithms
- 2D Arrays
- Strings
- Bit Manipulation
- Recursion
- Divide and Conquer
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

## Features

- **Organized Structure**: Code is divided into folders based on the DSA topic.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Solutions focus on time and space complexity optimizations.
- **Well-documented Code**: Each solution is accompanied by comments to explain the logic and steps involved.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
